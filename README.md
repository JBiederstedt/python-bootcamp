# Python Projects (100 Days of Code)

This repository contains my personal solutions, exercises, and projects completed during the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. Over the span of 100 days, I followed along with each video lesson, practiced the concepts, and built the associated mini-projects and challenges.
